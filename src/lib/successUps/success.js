        "Startup Name & Founder(s)": "Airbnb — Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, Nathan Blecharczyk",
        "The Dream": "The founders couldn’t afford rent in San Francisco. They saw travelers struggling to find affordable stays during peak events and thought: 'Why not let people rent out spare rooms?'",
        "The Journey": "Started by hosting guests on air mattresses in their apartment ('Air Bed & Breakfast'). Initially failed to attract users, so they personally photographed hosts’ homes to make listings more appealing. Faced funding rejections until they got into Y Combinator, which helped them refine and scale.",
        "Breakthrough Moment": "During the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, hotels were sold out. Their platform boomed, and people realized the concept worked.",
        "Revenue Model": "Airbnb charges a service fee from both hosts and guests for each booking.",
        "Current Impact": "Operates in 220+ countries. Over 150 million users. Valued at over $100 billion (IPO in 2020).",
        "Lesson for Dreamers": "Solve a real, painful problem. Be ready to do things that 'don’t scale' (like taking photos themselves)."

        "Startup Name & Founder(s)": "Zomato — Deepinder Goyal, Pankaj Chaddah",
        "The Dream": "The founders noticed colleagues queuing up to look at restaurant menus in their office cafeteria. They thought: 'What if menus were accessible online?'",
        "The Journey": "Launched as 'Foodiebay', uploading scanned menus of restaurants in Delhi. Expanded to other cities by building a crowdsourced model. Rebranded as Zomato and added features like reviews, ratings, and later online ordering.",
        "Breakthrough Moment": "Once they launched the restaurant discovery + ordering combo, it became the go-to app for eating out and delivery.",
        "Revenue Model": "Commission from restaurants for orders. Ads and premium listings. Subscription services (Zomato Gold, now Zomato Pro).",
        "Current Impact": "Serves millions of users daily. Expanded to multiple countries. IPO valued at $13+ billion in 2021.",
        "Lesson for Dreamers": "Start small, focus on solving one pain point (access to menus). Scale gradually by adding value at every stage."

      "sections": {
        "Startup Name & Founder(s)": "Spotify — Daniel Ek, Martin Lorentzon",
        "The Dream": "In 2006, music piracy (Napster, Limewire) was rampant. They dreamed of making music accessible legally, instantly, and affordably.",
        "The Journey": "Negotiated difficult licensing deals with music labels. Focused on creating a seamless streaming experience with low latency. Used an invite-only launch to build exclusivity and hype.",
        "Breakthrough Moment": "Launched in 2008 in Sweden, where piracy was highest, proving people would pay if given a better experience.",
        "Revenue Model": "Freemium model: free ad-supported streaming + premium subscription.",
        "Current Impact": "600+ million users, 230M+ paying subscribers. Market cap of $50+ billion. World’s biggest music streaming service.",
        "Lesson for Dreamers": "Don’t just fight piracy, out-innovate it. Distribution (licensing + access) is as important as product quality."

        "Startup Name & Founder(s)": "BYJU’S — Byju Raveendran",
        "The Dream": "Byju saw students struggling to learn through rote methods in India. He envisioned a fun, interactive way to learn — especially for competitive exams.",
        "The Journey": "Started as offline coaching for CAT exams, where Byju’s teaching style attracted thousands. Converted lessons into engaging videos with visuals and animations. Launched BYJU’S app in 2015, targeting school students as well.",
        "Breakthrough Moment": "The app’s popularity during exam seasons skyrocketed downloads. Parents saw results, and BYJU’S became the go-to edtech platform.",
        "Revenue Model": "Subscription plans for courses. Premium content and live classes. Partnerships with schools.",
        "Current Impact": "Over 100 million students globally. Valued at over $20 billion at peak (though facing corrections now).",
        "Lesson for Dreamers": "Start with one strong niche (CAT prep) and expand. Make education fun → engagement drives results."
